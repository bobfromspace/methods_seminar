## Footnotes

Some text^[Footnote text].

Also, some text[^1]. And then even more.

[^1]:More footnotes.

## Citing & Referencing

Let's cite @Simon2001 and his work [@Simon2001] but by using `nocite` in the header we will include all publications in the specified file in the References section.


## Equations

Inline $\beta$ and $\epsilon$.

On a separate line:

$$y=\beta X + \epsilon$$

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="See, this is a caption."}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including tables

Here's just a summary table. You can read [{knitr}'s documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.28/topics/kable) and do even more.

```{r kable_table, echo=FALSE}
kable(summary(pressure),
      # use LaTeX's package {booktabs} for fancy tables
      booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = "My caption",
      col.names = c("Temperature", "Pressure"))
```

## Including regression tables

There are other packages but [{stargazer}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf) is my first love once and for all.

```{r stargazer_table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
stargazer(lm(temperature ~ pressure, data = pressure),
          type = "latex",
          header=FALSE,
          title = "Amazing regression table",
          dep.var.labels = "Temperature",
          covariate.labels = "Pressure")
```

## Referring to the coefficients

```{r prepare the coefficient, echo=FALSE}
adj_rsquared <- summary(lm(temperature ~ pressure, data = pressure))[["adj.r.squared"]]
```

Temperature is a dependant variable, and Pressure is the independant. Adjusged R^2^ is `r round(adj_rsquared, 2)`, which indicates a considerable linear relationship.
