## Citing & Referencing

Let's cite @Simon2001 and his work [@Simon2001] but by using `nocite` in the header we will include all publications in the specified file in the References section.


## Equations

Inline $\beta$ and $\epsilon$.

On a separate line:

$$y_{i} =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i} + \epsilon$$

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="See, this is a caption."}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including tables

```{r flextable_table, echo=FALSE}
basic_table <- flextable(head(pressure))
named_table <- set_header_labels(basic_table, temperature = "Temperature", pressure = "Pressure")
fit_table <- autofit(named_table)
caption_table <- set_caption(fit_table, "My caption")
caption_table
```

## Including regression tables

It doesn't look so dashing as {stargazer}, but still not that bad. 

```{r regression_table, echo=FALSE}
mod <- lm(temperature ~ pressure, data = pressure)
reg_table <- as_flextable(mod)
booktbs_table <- theme_booktabs(reg_table)
fit_table <- autofit(booktbs_table)
set_caption(fit_table, "Regression table, Temperature is dependant variable.")
```

## Referring to the coefficients

```{r prepare the coefficient, echo=FALSE}
adj_rsquared <- summary(lm(temperature ~ pressure, data = pressure))[["adj.r.squared"]]
```

Temperature is a dependant variable, and Pressure is the independant. Adjusged R^2^ is `r round(adj_rsquared, 2)`, which indicates a considerable linear relationship.
